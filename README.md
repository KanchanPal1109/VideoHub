Installed Packages:
Below is a list of packages installed in the project. These packages are listed in the package.json file 

under the dependencies section:

react: The core React library for building user interfaces.
react-dom: Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web application to enable React components.
react-router-dom: Allows for declarative routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different views/components.
react-player: A React component for playing various media types, such as video and audio.
@fortawesome/fontawesome-free: Provides a library of FontAwesome icons for use in the application.
Detailed Description:
components/: This directory contains React components responsible for rendering different parts of the application's user interface. Each component is typically defined in its own file for modularity and reusability. Example components include Header.js, Login.js, Register.js, and more.

css/: Here reside the CSS stylesheets used to style the application components. The styles.css file may contain global styles applicable to the entire application, while other CSS files such as Register.css and Login.css may contain component-specific styles.

ContextApi/: This folder houses the context and hooks used for managing user data. The UserContext.js file likely contains the context provider and custom hook for accessing user-related data throughout the application. Other files in this folder may include additional context providers or related utilities.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that FontAwesome icons are imported and used appropriately in the components where needed.
The project structure is organized to facilitate easy navigation and maintenance of the codebase.
Each directory serves a specific purpose, separating concerns and improving code organization.
New components, stylesheets, or context-related files can be added to their respective directories without cluttering the project structure.
